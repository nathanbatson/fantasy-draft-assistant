=== Fantasy Draft Assistant

This is a work in progress and just an expirement in AngularJS and Rails4

This is hard coded with my keeprs and custom rankings from CBS fantasy league, and imports from their CSV export of player stat projections.

To get started:

<tt>bundle update</tt>
<tt>rake db:create</tt>
<tt>rake db:migrate</tt>
<tt>rake db:seed</tt>

Then start the server:

<tt>bundle exec rails server</tt>
